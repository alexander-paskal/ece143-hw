# Introduction

Here are homework assignments completed for UCSD ECE143. For prospective
employers perusing this repo, look at hw8, as those problems were the
most involved and have the best visualizations for their solutions. The rest of the
problems are less interesting, so I didn't spend the time to clean them up.

Problem descriptions are found in the module docstrings.

# Environment

The following packages are necessary to run the assignments:

- numpy >= 1.20.1
- pandas >= 1.2.4
- matplotlib >= 3.3.4

# How to Run

Each module can be run directly from the terminal
    
    >>> C:/Users/first.last/ECE143-Fa21/hw8 python convex_cover.py

To modify the test values, go into the 'main' section at the bottom of the module in question and modify the variables denoted with comments as "arguments". See module docstring for the provided description on valid arguments.
